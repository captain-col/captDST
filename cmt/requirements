# A package to setup a user area to analyze a Data Summary Tree (DST).  The
# DST is created using the captSummary package and contains several trees.
# This package provides the tools to simplify handling of the DST without
# depending on the rest of the CAPTAIN software.

# NOTICE: This package needs ROOT, but does not have to depend on ROOT.  It
# only needs the root executable in the path.  You can use a previously
# (not part of CAPTAIN software) ROOT by setting the CMTEXTRATAGS
# environment variable to "export CMTEXTRATAGS=external_root".  If
# CMTEXTRATAGS has not been set, then the standard LCGCMT version of ROOT
# will be used.
